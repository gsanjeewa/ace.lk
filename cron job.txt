recently I had sort of problems to run a cron job on a php script on localhost (WAMP server) in windows 7, when I was on a test to chronically fetch some links from www out there.

By the way I am sharing this for anyone that is on the same thing.

You will need a shellscript to run chronically, using Windows Task Scheduler. Also you will need a batch script (script.bat) to call the php.exe and run your php script (here called as my_process.php)

shellscript.vbs

Set WinScriptHost = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
WinScriptHost.Run Chr(34) & "C:\path\to\script\script.bat" & Chr(34), 0
Set WinScriptHost = Nothing

script.bat

"C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.4.12\php.exe" -f "C:\wamp\www\website\my_process.php"

Now, we are ready to set the Windows Task Scheduler to run shellscript.vbs at the required time interval:

    Open Task Scheduler from windows Start menu
    Go to Action menu and hit Create Task...
    in General tab, fill the Name and Description fields as you want
    in Triggers tab, hit New button.
    from Begin the Task dropdown, select On a schedule and choose Daily
    from Advanced settings section, select Repeat task every as you want and set for a duration on Indefinitely.
    on Actions tab, from Action dropdown, select Start a program.
    on the Program\script box, enter path to shellscript.vbs like C:\path\to\shellscript.vbs.
    leave Add argumentts (optional) section empty.
    in Start in (optional) box, enter parent directory of shellscript.vbs like C:\path\to\.
